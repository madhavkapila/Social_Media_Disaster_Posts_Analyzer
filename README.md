# Social_Media_Disaster_Posts_Analyzer
An automated pipeline to scrape disaster related posts from various social media platforms that are trending or tagging various disaster related pages, then analysing content of those posts for their location, authenticity, disaster's severity, any help/resources needed, etc. It will only give these features if the post is really about disaster.
